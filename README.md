Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

**#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering**

**1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**

Software Engineering is a branch of computer science essential for developing, testing, deploying and maintaining of programs and softwares.

(i). Innovation:- Software engineering provides the tools and frameworks that enable developers to create innovative solutions.
(ii). Scalability: Well-engineered software can be easily updated, debugged, and scaled according to users' needs, tastes, and preferences.
(iii) Flexibility: Well-designed software ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
(iv). Efficiency:- Software engineering helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
(v). Security:- Software engineering implements practices for building secure systems, protecting sensitive data, minimising vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with ethical regulations.

**2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**

(i). The Advent of High-Level Programming Languages (1950s-1960s):-The development of high-level programming languages like FORTRAN (1957) and COBOL (1959) marked a significant shift from machine-level and assembly languages. These languages allowed developers to write code that was more human-readable and easier to maintain.
(ii). The Introduction of Structured Programming (1970s):-The development of structured programming improved software reliability and maintainability. It encouraged the use of clear, hierarchical structures instead of complex, unstructured code. Languages like Pascal and C were developed and supported structured programming.
(iii). The Emergence of Agile SDLC and DevOps (2000s): Agile Methodology was created by software developers as a solution to the shortcomings of conventional models such as the Waterfall approach. The later development of DevOps practices in the late 2000s transformed software development by focusing on adaptability, teamwork with customers, and ongoing delivery.

**3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**

(i). Problem Definition:- this initial stage identifies the problem to be solved and how it fits with current business oppotunities and technology in line with the organisation goals and objectives.
(ii). Feasibility Study:- it is a research into the possibility of developing a solution to a problem. The study is to justify or nullify the change of modification of the current system.
(iii). System Analysis:- it is the process of collecting and analysing facts in respect of existing operations, procedures and systems in order to obtain a full appreciation of the situation prevailing so that an effective computerized systems may be designed and implemented.
(iv). System Design:- in this stage, designing the software happens according to the requirement specifications in order to come withe the best architecture for the software to be developed.
(v). Programming and Testing:- in this stage, developers have to follow the coding guidelines defined by their organization and programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers are used to generate the code. The programming language is chosen with respect to the type of software being developed.
(vi). Implementation:- it is putting the software into live operation. This is after the system is fully tested, well documented and the staff to be involved in the running of the system are trained.
(vii). Review:- it is necessary to review the software to ensure that the initial aims of the system are being closely met.
(viii). Maintenance:- it includes all the activities associated with changing any program, procedure or documentation for an operational information system to keep the system operating correctly.

**4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**



**5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**



**6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**



**7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**



**8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**



**#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering**


**9. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**
Prompt engineering:- this is the art of crafting questions or statements to get refined and the best responses from AI LLMs.

**10. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**

Vague prompt:- Name the tyes of breeds pf dogs.
Improved prompt:- What are the top three breeds of dogs for families with young children, and what are their key characteristics?
Reasons why the improved is more effective
Clarity:- by asking "what are the top three breeds of gogs for families with young children", this specific focus eliminates ambiguity about what aspect of dogs the user is interested in.
Preciseness:- narrows down the response, making it clear that the user is looking for a ranked list rather than general information about all dogs.
Conciseness:- the additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated making it easire for the response to be generated.
